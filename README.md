Hello,

This is my first React app, a From validation app.


You can try this out here: 

What was difficult? 
Everything, and i was very slow. But i learn a lot from this project: 
Use props, to send data not just down, but also up, 
use onChange and onBlur event
use useState(),
use components,
use different css things, eg. something.module.css or just something.css
