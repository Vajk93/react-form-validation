Hello,

This is my first React app, an interactive From validation app.

Let's try this out here: https://react-form-validation-good.web.app/

What was difficult? 
Everything, and i was very slow, but i have learnt a lot from this project: 
Use props, to send data not just down, but also up, 
use onChange and onBlur event
use useState(),
use components,
use different css things, eg. something.module.css or just something.css or inline css
